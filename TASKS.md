- [ ] Add canonical `TG_` precedence tests for wait and backoff env vars that only have validation coverage
  **ID**: expand-tg-precedence-coverage
  **Tags**: tests, env, compatibility
  **Details**: The repo migration to canonical `TG_` env vars is covered for many knobs, but some settings such as `TG_EMPTY_QUEUE_WAIT` still only have invalid-value tests. Add focused precedence coverage for the remaining wait/backoff-style knobs so future refactors do not silently prefer the legacy `DVB_` alias.
  **Files**: `tests/diagnostics.bats`, `tests/network.bats`, `tests/session.bats`
  **Acceptance**: The affected env vars have red/green coverage proving `TG_` overrides the matching `DVB_` value during a real run, not just in validation error paths.
